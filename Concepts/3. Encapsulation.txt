Encapsulation is the process of wrapping of data and functions of a class together so that they can be applied as an unit to perform any operation.

It is one of the most fundamental concepts of OOP.Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class thus preventing unauthorized access.This is called data hiding.

Therefore, data binding and data hiding are the two main goals of data encapsulation.
