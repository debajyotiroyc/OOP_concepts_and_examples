In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

The user-defined objects are created using the class keyword. The class is a blueprint that defines a nature of a future object. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class. Classes are used to create and manage new objects and support inheritanceâ€”a key ingredient in object-oriented programming and a mechanism of reusing code.

Classes are like a template/blueprint which define the details of an object.
It is a prototype that describes the attributes(state) and actions(behaviour) of an object.
Objects are instances of a Class, which inherits the data members and methods.
